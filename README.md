This is the code for our paper "Label-Specific Document Representation for Multi-Label Text Classification" 

Requirements: Ubuntu 16.0.4;
  Python 3.6.7;
  Pytorch 1.0.0;
  mxnet 1.3.1;
  
Reproducibility: We provide the processed dataset AAPD, put them in the folder./data/
Train: python classification.py

Note: Due to the paper is still waiting to be accepted, we have not published all the code. 
The complete code will be published after the paper is accepted. But in order to reproduce the experimental resultsï¼Œwe provide executable files under Linux, put it in the folder./dist/
